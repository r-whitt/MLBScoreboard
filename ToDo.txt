4) Add Loading Wheel?
3)Pretty up Date Picker? 
	Make a border that it fits in or an image that it fits in? 
5) Make No Score Display Something?
6) Either Disable Current Date & Future Dates or have them show construction pages and not the normal historcal data scores
8) add Postponed logic to prevent score tables from showing? July 5th, 2017 - Mets Nationals
9) Add Current Date (Date that will pull first) as yesterday (current - 1 day)
10) Refactor code - Remove Console.logs, remove test functions/variables, add A LOT of comments to help other people reading code
11) Add ReadMe to walk through how to setup (install vue-resources, wheel loading library too?)





When using the Date Picker to Select, make sure there are leading 0s before creating the URL
	Currently it is error because the URL is wrong
		Good: 
			http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2017/month_08/day_09/master_scoreboard.json
		Bad: 
			gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2017/month_8/day_9/master_scoreboard.json

Date Picker currently doesn't show 1st week if it showed on the previous Month

Create movable innings for extra innings above 10
	Currently should be 10 columns
		9 for the innings & 1 empty for spacing between innings & summar
		and 1 leading beore Teams & Innings
	Should: 
		Use empty column between Teams & inning to hold the buttons to show different innings
		Then use the last empty column before the summary to show a 10th inning
		The buttons should only appear if there are more than 10 innings





Should We?
	Should we show the scores in 2 columns 
	OR
	Add more information to the right of the scores like Pitchers, HRs, clips?
